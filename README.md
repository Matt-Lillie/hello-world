# hello-world
Fresh out the blocks
I am an energetic graduate, who attained an honors degree in Logistics Management at the University of Stellenbosch in 2017. I was born in Johannesburg, which is where I spent majority of my life and is where my close family lives. After nearly four years of study and four months of working and traveling in the United States, the time has come to move on and start a new chapter in my life. 
I would consider myself a person who has developed a mature and responsible approach to any task that I undertake or situation that I am presented with. I have a clear, logical mind with a practical approach to problem solving and a drive to see things through to completion. I am a hard worker and have a great eye for detail. I am eager to further my knowledge, I enjoy overcoming challenges, and I have a genuine interest in working in the field of logistics and supply chain management. Thus, I have a keen interest to further strengthen my skills and abilities I already possess.
